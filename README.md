This is the backend for our blog project. 
Download this and the front-end, which is my MVCservicesStructure repository.

Have them in 2 different folders.

1) In the folder with the back-end run:
   npm run start
   (If this does not work be sure to have enabled the mongo database in your system: sudo systemctl start mongodb) 

1.Check) In order to check it works properly, try with postman to send get request and others.



For the front end:

Just open the index.html file in a browser. 

It is only left to add the edit post button and use the backend. With a put or patch call, that do work because we tried with postman.
